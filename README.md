# About Me
Hi , I am Rachit Jauhari. I am a Data Scientist. This is my portfolio where I am listing my Data Science passion projects. 
I have worked as a Senior Data Analyst in my recent roles where I worked closely with technology and Business. 
Connecting dots to show how, why and when a problem has occurred, and providing strategic solutions for these challenges is my asset.
My goal for 2020 is to contribute more to Github open source projects.

# Passion Projects
## Project 1: Housing-Prices-Prediction
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes dataset, the objective isto predict the final price of each home. [Please click here for github repository](https://github.com/rachitj/Housing-Prices-Prediction)
### Steps
* Performed data analysis and feature engineering
* Explored and analyzed data and outliers
* Machine Learning Model Building :Cross-Validation, Hyper-parameter Tuning, Linear Regression, SVM, Decion Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor
* Deep Learning : Building ANN
* Choose the best model

## Project 2 : E-commerce Orders Revenue Analysis
"Company X" sells cannabis online via their e-commerce Shopify platform. To fulfill their reporting requirements, the Company X Finance department asks you to create a report so they can process their Q1 financial results.

### Goal: 
* To provide a dashboard to the Finance department about the sales results for Q1.
* Analyze the data and present any insights
* Automate the code and structure of data

#### Step 1 : Get the relevant orders data from order.json file in data_collection.ipynb file
#### Step 2 : Get the relevant exchange rates data from api in data_collection.ipynb file
#### Step 3 : Export the data to SQL tables in data_models.ipynb file
#### Step 4 : Creation of fact_sales in SQL Server 2019
#### Step 5 : Create interactive tableau dashboards

## Project 3 : Operation Analytics for a Healthcare Provider
The focus of our project was to analyze the comparison of the four units namely -MBU, Medical, Surgical and Telemetry for Bon Secours in Norfolk, Virginia.
* Objective : To Provide analysis and findings for each unit, a brief summary for each unit to look at areas of improvement and key insights, and the overall recommendations
* Analysis : I evaluated variables such as turnover, HCAHPS scores, shift length and used our visit to the hospital and comments from nurses and various workers to piece together a picture of what is going on with Bon Secours.
* Performed Data mining, Feture -Engineering, Multi-variance Regression Analysis, Hypothesis test, Control charts, Forecasting
* Tools and Technologies: R, Tableau, SQL,MS Project, Excel
* Note : As this is my realtime prject in a professional work environment, I am unable to post any code due to confidentiality issues.


## Project 4 : Lean six sigma for package pickup and delivery company
* Project business Case: A package pickup and delivery company which OUTSOURCES its ground operations to a third party. Inefficiency in processes and miscommunication leads rebates and idle time costs. Gross margin needs to be improved to sustain operations and for growth in future
* Problem Statement:Â Identify causes behind current inefficiencies (rebate and idle cost) impacting gross margin.
* Goal: To suggest improvements in the system for achieving at least 30% profit before tax with minimum errors and defects
* Techniques Used: Multi-variance Regression Analysis, Control Charts, CTQ, SIPOC, Value Stream Map and Future State, Sigma Measurement, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Pugh Matrix, Root Cause Analysis, Poke Yoke, Data Collection, Data Mining, Data Analysis, Financial Analysis
* Tools : Python, Microsoft Excel
* Note : As this is my realtime prject in a professional work environment, I am unable to post any code due to confidentiality issues.

## Project 5 : Power BI Model for Regional Sales Managers and Decision Makers
This model provided real time information such as Products and Customers Segmentation, Sales and Profit Metrics, Churn (Revenue and Customers) as well as Forecasts.
* Created data pipelines in SQL and Data cubes
* Wrote DAX in Power Query
* Created Dasbhboards for Sales and Churn Metrics
* Tools and Technologies: Power Bi, MS SQL Server, DAX
* Note : As this is my realtime prject in a professional work environment, I am unable to post any code due to confidentiality issues.
