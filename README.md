With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes dataset, the objective isto predict the final price of each home.
### Steps
1. Made necessary changes in code for Google Colab usage
2. Import the training and test dataset
3. Merge the test and training datasets
4. Perform Feature Engineering
5. Expolre and analyze data and outliers
6. Outliers Treatment
7. Machine Learning Model Building :
   1. Cross-Validation
   2. Hyper-parameter Tuning
   3. Linear Regressions
   4. SVM
   5. Decion Tree Regressor
   6. Random Forest Regressor
7. Deep Learning : Building ANN
8. Choose the best model
